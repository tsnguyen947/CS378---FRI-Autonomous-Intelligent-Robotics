# CS378---FRI-Autonomous-Intelligent-Robotics
Collection of all of the programming projects I developed while taking CS378

This repository contains the projects that I developed while enrolled in the Freshman Research Initiative, 
Autonomous Intelligent Robotics stream. I developed these projects using ROS Hydro to run the programs on a mobile platform.
I mostly focused on computer vision while enrolled so most of my projects are computer vision applications.
The algorithms used to develop these projects pulled from outside libraries like the Point Cloud Library and
OpenCV library.
